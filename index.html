    <h1>Demo on Variables</h1>
    1. Declaring Variables<br><br>

          In JavaScript, you can declare variables using three keywords:<br><br>

        A. var (Oldest way):<br><br>
            • Function-scoped.<br>
            • Can be re-declared and updated within the same scope.<br>
            • Does not support block-scoping (it ignores {} boundaries).<br><br>

        B. let (Modern and recommended for mutable variables):<br><br>
            • Block-scoped.<br>
            • Can be updated but not re-declared in the same block.<br><br>

        C. const (Modern and for constants):<br><br>
            • Block-scoped.<br>
            • Must be initialized at the time of declaration.<br>
            • Cannot be updated or re-declared.<br><br>

    2. Variable Naming Rules<br><br>

            • Names can include letters, digits, underscores (_), and dollar signs ($).<br>
            • Must begin with a letter, $, or _.<br>
            • Are case-sensitive (myVar and myvar are different).<br>
            • Cannot use reserved keywords (e.g., var, let, class, etc.).<br><br>

    3. Variable Scope<br><br>

        Scope defines where a variable is accessible:<br><br>

            1.Global Scope: Variables declared outside any function or block are 
               globally scoped.<br>
            2.Function Scope: Variables declared with var inside a function are only 
               accessible within that function.<br>
            3.Block Scope: Variables declared with let or const inside {} are only accessible 
                  within that block. <br><br>

    4. Variable Hoisting<br><br>

            • Variables declared with var are “hoisted” to the top of their scope but remain 
               uninitialized until the code execution reaches their declaration.<br>
            • Variables declared with let and const are also hoisted but cannot be used before 
               their declaration due to the temporal dead zone.<br><br>

    5. Data Types in Variables<br><br>

        JavaScript variables can store different types of data:<br><br>

            1.Primitive Types:<br><br>

                   • String: "Hello"<br>
                   • Number: 42<br>
                   • Boolean: true or false<br>
                   • Undefined: A declared variable without a value.<br>
                   • Null: Represents the absence of a value.<br>
                   • Symbol: Unique and immutable value.<br>
                   • BigInt: For very large integers.<br><br>

            2.Non-Primitive Types:<br><br>

                   • Object: { key: "value" }<br>
                   • Array: [1, 2, 3]<br>
                   • Function: function() {}<br><br>

    6. Best Practices<br><br>

        • Use const by default. Only use let if you need to reassign the variable.<br>
        • Avoid var unless maintaining older code.<br>
        • Use descriptive names for variables.<br><br>
